java c Design and Implementation of an Electronic Circuit ECE5882/6882 Explanation: The goal of this project is to design, simulate and build an electronic circuit for ECE5882/6882. Suggested project examples are: 1-  Analog sensing interface circuit for multiple channel reading 2-  AM/FM radio design 3-  Wireless power/energy transfer circuits 4-  PLL circuit for an application 5-  Mixer circuit design for an application 6-  Radar RF circuit for movement and distance sensing 7-  Analog/digital interface circuits 8-  Power amplifiers 9-  Your project choice-please discuss with us. This can be apart of project you are already been involved, e.g. final year project General Requirements: •   You should identify an application and derive specifications according to the application selected. •   Your electronic circuit should work according to the specifications you derived and set to achieve. •   The circuit parameters and frequencies should be selected according to the application selected. •   Determine the transfer functions where necessary. •   You can have a group with two members. Or you could do the project individually. For a group project, you should clearly define each member’s contribution in the report. Individual mark will be given to group members. Circuit Requirements: •   Your project should contain a minimum of 6 transistors and 2 op-amps. •   Design the circuits for optimum performance and achieve stability. Explain and derive equations and parameters that you used to optimise your circuits. •   Each individual circuit block should be optimised according to concepts provided in the lectures. •   You should show simulation/experimental results both in time and frequency domain to justify that your individual circuit blocks are operating as expected. •   Simulation part: Select non-ideal transistors and provide the spice model or detailed model of the transistors used. •   If you need to use an IC chip for your project, however clearly mention the reason of using the chip. e.g. input signal generation or processing output signal etc. Design steps: 1-  Analytic design (calculations, component values and system level specifications etc.) 2-  Circuit-level simulation using LTspice or ADS. 3-  Circuit implementation and prototyping on Vero board 4-  Altium layout design (Bonus mark: if you fabricate a PCB for your design) Report:You report should not exceed 10 pages (including everything except for the title page). You can submit one report per group. Explain clearly how you derive the component values. Include design considerations and schematics of each individual block. A set of simulation and measurement results could include the following items: Time domain waveforms and frequency domain spectra Plots of gain versus frequency (AC Analysis) if important for your design Power consumption (measured and calculated) Transfer functions (output versus input voltages/currents) Signal quality and noise measurements. You should generate an input signal according to the input specifications defined for your applic代 写ECE5882/6882 Design and Implementation of an Electronic CircuitMatlab 代做程序编程语言ation Other important results that show the performance of your electronics circuit overallSummarise important results in tables and figures. Explain important technical details of your design. Also, compare your circuit simulation/experimental results with those of analytical calculations. Groups: The project should be done in a group of two.  Clearly define each member’s contribution in the report. Individual mark will be given to group members. Bonus Marks: You will receive additional 10 points (out of 100) if you fabricate PCB circuit and test it. If you like to fabricate your PCB, please let one of teaching demonstrators know. Grading: See the attached grading sheet at the end of this document. Submission: Submit your report using the submission link in Moodle before Week 12, October 14, Monday, 16:30 pm. Demonstrations: Demonstrations of projects will be in Week 12 during your lab sessions. Some References: You don’t need to follow these references. These are just given for you to gain some ideas. It is up to you to find best references for your design. References: [1]. https://wiki.analog.com/university/courses/electronics/ [2]. C. Coleman, An Introduction to Radio Frequency Engineering.
